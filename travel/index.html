                I have always travelled all around the world. My family always made time to travel and gain life experience in that way. I have been all around North and Central America, Europe, Africa, Asia and Australia (South America is on my list!!). 
            </p>
            <p class="lead"> 
                I have stumbled across the Krampus festival in Austria, rode a bicycle through the forest to see a Rammstein concert in Denmark, ate my first baguette in France, spent the summer solstice in Iceland, roadtripped all around Ireland and Northern Ireland, climbed up the leaning tower of Pisa in Italy, rode countless trains in England, was denied entrance into the Vatican City until I changed into my mom's (more modest) clothing, got 178 sandflea bites in the Bahamas, sunbathed in Belize, swam with stingrays in the Cayman Islands, got food poisoning in Cuba, snorkelled in the Dominican Republic, jumped off a 40 foot cliff into crystal blue water in Jamaica, had a drunk guy point a gun at me in Mexico, ran over an iguana in Puerto Rico, sat underneath an airplane as it landed in Saint Maarten, roadtripped around the United States in a small RV with my entire family, went on safari in Botswana, went shark cage diving in South Africa, climbed an active volcano in Indonesia, ate sushi in Japan, spent half a year living in Australia and jumped out of an airplane in New Zealand!

                I have also been to a bunch of other countries but never left the airport, so in my book that doesn’t count. I will always save up money to travel, to me it’s an absolute must and a no-brainer to make travel a part of my life. A few of the places that are high up on my list of places that I want to travel to are (but not limited to): Norway, the Maldives, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Turkey.
