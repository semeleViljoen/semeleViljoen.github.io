At first, I applied to the University of Exeter in England, however after getting accepted I felt that it was the wrong decision and I reapplied to the University of Newcastle in Australia. Once I got accepted, the time didn’t feel right, and I deferred for a semester. Once I got to Newcastle I knew that I had made all the right decisions and I was exactly where I was meant to be.</p>
