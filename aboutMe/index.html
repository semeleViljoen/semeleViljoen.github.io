        <p>Hello!</p>
    
        <p>Welcome to my ePortfolio! Here is a little bit about me!</p>
    
        <p>
        	I was born in Saskatoon, SK on May 17, 1994. My parents are from South Africa and although I was not born there, I still identify as being a South African. I spent a lot of time there while I was growing up and I learned to speak Afrikaans at the same time as I learned to speak English! We moved to Calgary, AB when I was 5 and I stayed there until I was 18. During my childhood I spent a lot of time at my family’s cabin in Fernie, BC playing in the snow and skiing. I learned how to ski when I was 22 months old, and even though ski lessons were a pain in the butt when I was younger, I really love skiing to this day. I never played any sports throughout middle school (I was one of two people that didn’t make the badminton team in grade 6…), but it never really bothered me because I loved running around outside and jumping on my trampoline and skiing and riding my dirt bike. During high school I took school fairly seriously while also maintaining a good social life. In grade 11 I took a trip with some of my classmates to Botswana where we would be building houses for two families that really needed it. It was one of the best experiences of my life! In grade 12 I went on a marine biology trip all around the Gulf islands and I fell in love with the Vancouver Island area! I decided to apply to the University of Victoria and I didn’t apply anywhere else because there was nowhere else I wanted to go. Once I got accepted I started with a biology degree, but quickly came to realize that it wasn’t for me, so I applied and got accepted into the Kinesiology program. I have loved (almost) every moment of this degree and I have learned so much and I have gained such an appreciation for the human body and everything it can do! I entered the program thinking that I wanted to apply to medical school, but in the last two years of my degree I decided that I actually really wanted to be a chiropractor, so I applied to Palmer College of Chiropractic in San Jose, California and recently got accepted! My education is nowhere near finished, but I am extremely excited to move to California and start a new adventure learning more and more about the human body and how to help people be the best they can be!
